  execute your implementation of the guessing game program that you 
  implemented in Homework 1 using two different levels of optimization:

  - When your program is compiled using the -O0 flag:

    ```
Instruction counts:
ADD: 6
SUB: 4
MUL: 1
DIV: 0
MOV: 50
LEA: 6
PUSH: 2
POP: 0
RET: 2

Total Instructions: 71
Total Cycles: 85
    ```

  - When your program is compiled using the -O3 flag:

    ```
Instruction counts:
ADD: 9
SUB: 6
MUL: 2
DIV: 0

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the 
servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete 
and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are 
compiled strictly for our machine's architecture, and this is a consistent 
architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. 
  Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we 
  grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we 
  can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget to push your changes in your private repo for grading before 
  the assignment deadline!**
