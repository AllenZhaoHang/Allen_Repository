## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Instructions

It is now time to implement the guessing game in main.c. The requirements of 
the program are as follows:

You will play the guessing game a total of 5 times in a row.
Each round a new number must be randomly generated, which is a number from 1 
to 10.
The user will guess the number.
If the number is correct, then the game ends.
If the number is wrong, then a hint should be provided whether the correct 
number is higher or lower.
Each time a user guesses, you should increment how many guesses the user has 
made for the round.
When the user guesses the correct answer, output that they have finished.
Then either start a new game, or if 5 rounds have been played then output the 
summary of how many guesses the user made over 5 games.
You should use an 'array' data structure to store the number of guesses made 
each round.

### Important notes
* Note: Don't forget to read the entire assignment on Canvas: the homework is not just this Guessing Game program!
* Note: Your code **must** compile and run on the Khoury machines. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* Note: You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
