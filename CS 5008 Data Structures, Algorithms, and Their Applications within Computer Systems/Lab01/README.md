Once you are comfortable, write a C program on the Khoury machines in the 
file main.c.

The program will contain a function with the signature 
	'double power(double base, double n)'.

Your program will call this function in a loop in the main function, 
computing the first power(2,1) to power(2,10) and print out these results 
to the terminal.  Note: Your power function only needs to handle positive 
values.

You can compile your program with: gcc main.c -o main to see if it works.
You will then type ./main to run the program.

Once you have a working program, remember to add/commit/push your files to 
your repo. We do not need to include any of the temporary files that may be 
generated by the compiler. These include files with the .o extension as well 
as the executable file you create, like main.  You should try to avoid 
adding the executable as well.
